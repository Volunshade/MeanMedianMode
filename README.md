# Calculate the Mean, Median, Mode

---

## Acceptence Critiera

+ 1 commit for each function
+ Should be completed in 4 functions
+ I want the average rounded to three decimal places
+ I want the median rounded to two decimal places
+ I want the mode returned as a list
+ 1 function to run MeanMedianMode for a dataset

---

## Input Data

```python
data_set_one = [6, 9, 1, 2, 6, 3, 7]
data_set_two = [6, 9, 1, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4]
data_set_three = [6, 9, 1, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 1]
```

## Additional Notes

```python
"""
Mean:

    Average of a data set

    get the sum of all the numbers & divide by however many numbers there are

Median:

    Middle number in a data set

    get the middle number in a data set that is ordered by value and if the length of the data set is even, then you give me the average of the two middle numbers

Mode:

    Most common number in a data set

    get the number that has the highest frequency in the data set, there can be multiple (there can also be no mode)

--------------------

The structure of the application should be as follows:

calc_mean funtion
  takes in a dataset
  returns the mean

calc_median funtion
  takes in a dataset
  returns the median

calc_mode function
  takes in a dataset
  returns the mode

solve_dataset function
  takes in a dataset
  returns mean, median, and mode

main function
  hard codes all datasets
  prints mean, median, and mode for each data set

--------------------

Your application should have a module docstring

All functions should have a docstring that describes what it does

Print statements with mean, median, and mode should be descriptive and not just numbers
